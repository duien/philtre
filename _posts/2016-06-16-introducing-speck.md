title: "Introducing Speck :tada:"
---

Speck is (theoretically) a Slack client for Elixir. It aims to provide a full-featured interface to all of Slack's integration points, along with helpers that make common interaction patterns easier. I'd like to think it's the kind of library that other libraries could use to make opinionated bot frameworks or other types of integrations.

Speck will include helpers for creating and formatting rich messages, wrappers for the web and streaming APIs (including structs representing the various types of responses), and tools to make it easier to create and test bots and slash commands.
