[Philtre of Volubility]({{ site.baseurl }}) is a chronicle of my attempt to learn Elixir by building a Slack client. I'll be walking through the purpose of the client, the tooling I discover and use as I go, and the engineering decisions I make along the way.

This will be the largest project I've attempted with Elixir to date, so there will probably be lots of learning through making mistakes.

Thanks for reading! :wave:
